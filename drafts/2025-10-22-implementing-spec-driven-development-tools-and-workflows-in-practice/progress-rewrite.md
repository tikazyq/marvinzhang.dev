# Progress Tracking: Spec-Driven Development in 2025 Article Rewrite

## Project Overview
- **Article**: Spec-Driven Development in 2025: Industrial Tools, Frameworks, and Best Practices
- **New Slug**: spec-driven-development-industrial-tools-frameworks-best-practices
- **Start Date**: 2025-10-24
- **Target Completion**: 2025-10-25
- **Current Status**: Outline Complete, Ready for Writing
- **Primary Agent**: GitHub Copilot Agent
- **Last Updated**: 2025-10-24

## Rewrite Objectives
- Expand from 2 tools (Spec Kit, Kiro) to 7 tools/frameworks (BMAD, OpenSpec, Spec Kit, Kiro, Tessl, Cline, AG2)
- Shift focus from tool tutorials to strategic guidelines and best practices
- Target technical leaders making adoption decisions rather than individual developers
- Provide comprehensive ecosystem map and decision frameworks
- Include real industry adoption data and ROI metrics

## Completed Phases

### ✅ Phase 1: Research (2025-10-24)
- [x] Comprehensive web research conducted
- [x] 7 tools/frameworks identified and researched:
  - BMAD (Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development) - Multi-agent framework
  - OpenSpec (Lightweight specification framework) - Accessible entry point
  - GitHub Spec Kit (Open-source CLI toolkit) - Most widely adopted
  - AWS Kiro (Enterprise IDE solution) - Cloud-native integration
  - Tessl ($125M funded platform) - Next-generation spec-as-source
  - Cline SDD Workflow (Practical workflow template) - AI agent integration
  - Agent OS (AG2) (Multi-agent orchestration framework) - Custom implementations
- [x] Industry best practices documented from production deployments
- [x] Adoption statistics gathered (YC 2025: 25% cohort, 95% AI-generated code)
- [x] ROI metrics collected (BMAD: 55% faster completion)
- [x] research.md completely rewritten with comprehensive findings
- **Completed by**: GitHub Copilot Agent

### ✅ Phase 2: Outline (2025-10-24)
- [x] Article completely restructured from 5 to 6 sections (Intro + 4 main + Conclusion)
- [x] Target audience repositioned from developers to technical leaders
- [x] Section focuses redefined:
  1. SDD Ecosystem Landscape (800 words) - Map all 7 tools by category
  2. Industry Best Practices (850 words) - Proven patterns from production
  3. Tool Selection Framework (800 words) - Decision criteria and recommendations
  4. Practical Implementation Roadmap (750 words) - Phased adoption strategy
- [x] Visual strategy expanded:
  - 4 Mermaid diagrams (ecosystem map, workflow patterns, multi-agent architecture, maturity model)
  - 4 decision tables (tool landscape, best practices, selection matrix, implementation roadmap)
- [x] Code examples minimized to 15 lines (configuration only, not implementation)
- [x] outline.md completely rewritten
- **Completed by**: GitHub Copilot Agent

## In-Progress Phase

### ⏳ Phase 3: Content Writing (In Progress)
- [ ] Update article frontmatter and rename file
- [ ] Write Introduction section (400 words) - Hook with YC statistic
- [ ] Write Section 1: SDD Ecosystem Landscape (800 words) - 4 categories, 7 tools
- [ ] Write Section 2: Industry Best Practices (850 words) - Proven patterns
- [ ] Write Section 3: Tool Selection Framework (800 words) - Decision criteria
- [ ] Write Section 4: Practical Implementation Roadmap (750 words) - Phased adoption
- [ ] Write Conclusion (400 words) - Strategic positioning
- **Target Word Count**: ~4000 words
- **Current Status**: Ready to begin
- **Next Action**: Start with Introduction

## Upcoming Phases

### Phase 4: Translation
- [ ] Translate full article to Chinese
- [ ] Apply 形不同而意同 principle for natural idiomatic expression
- [ ] Add English term annotations for technical concepts
- [ ] Add English names for notable individuals
- [ ] Ensure Chinese punctuation consistency
- [ ] Validate against Chinese writing guidelines
- **Target File**: `i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/2025-10-24-spec-driven-development-industrial-tools-frameworks-best-practices.mdx`

### Phase 5: Finalization
- [ ] Technical accuracy verification (all URLs functional)
- [ ] Code examples validation (syntax correct)
- [ ] Style consistency check (strategic voice maintained)
- [ ] MDX formatting verification (diagrams, tables, comments)
- [ ] Build validation (`pnpm run build`)
- [ ] Update article status (unlisted: false when ready to publish)
- [ ] Archive draft folder to `drafts/archive/`

## Quality Checkpoints

### Content Quality Standards
- ✅ Research: 7 tools comprehensively documented with authoritative sources
- ✅ Research: Industry adoption data and ROI metrics included
- ✅ Research: Best practices from production deployments
- ✅ Outline: Strategic focus appropriate for technical leaders
- ✅ Outline: Decision frameworks and actionable guidelines
- ✅ Outline: 4 Mermaid diagrams + 4 tables for visual-first approach
- [ ] Writing: Each section maintains single, clear focus
- [ ] Writing: Core concepts highlighted at first mention
- [ ] Writing: Inline references to authoritative sources
- [ ] Writing: Smooth transitions between sections
- [ ] Translation: 形不同而意同 - natural Chinese expression
- [ ] Translation: Technical accuracy preserved
- [ ] Final: Build succeeds without errors

## Key Differentiators from Previous Version

### Old Version
- Focused heavily on 2 specific tools (Spec Kit and Kiro)
- Tool implementation walkthrough emphasis
- Tutorial-style practical guide
- Target: Individual developers
- Word count: ~3500 words

### New Version
- Comprehensive tool landscape (7 tools/frameworks)
- Strategic guidelines and best practices emphasis
- Decision frameworks and adoption roadmaps
- Target: Technical leaders making adoption decisions
- Word count: ~4000 words

- Industry-wide analysis and trends

## Notes
- Article renamed to reflect comprehensive scope
- Date kept at 2025-10-22 to maintain continuity (original article date)
- Unlisted status will remain true until review complete
- Draft folder will be archived after publication
