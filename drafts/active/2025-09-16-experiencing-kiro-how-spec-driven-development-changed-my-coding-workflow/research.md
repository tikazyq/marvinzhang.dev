- Requirements Engineering and Design-by-Contract academic references
- AI development tool competitive analysis (ChatGPT, Copilot, Cursor, Claude)

### Code Examples Research
- **Example 1**: ArtiPub Multi-platform Publishing Architecture
  - Source: Real project development experience
  - Complexity: Advanced (multi-service integration)
  - Purpose: Demonstrates complexity that benefits from SDD approach
  - Testing status: Deployed in production (3,000+ GitHub stars)

- **Example 2**: EARS Requirements Format
  - Source: EARS methodology documentation
  - Complexity: Beginner (format template)
  - Purpose: Shows concrete structured requirements approach
  - Testing status: Applied in Kiro specs

## Key Concepts Identified
1. **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** - 3-phase methodology emphasizing upfront specification before implementation
2. **Requirements Drift Prevention** - Structured documentation prevents scope creep during development
3. **AI Communication Efficiency** - Structured context reduces verbose interactions with AI tools
4. **Task Breakdown Strategy** - Complex features split into manageable, incremental tasks
5. **Quality Gates** - Validation checkpoints between development phases

## Industry Context
- **Current trends**: Increasing software complexity, distributed teams, AI-assisted development adoption
- **Historical background**: Return to formal software engineering principles adapted for modern agile environments
- **Future outlook**: AI-human collaboration requiring better structured communication and context
- **Marvin's perspective**: Personal transformation from chaotic feature development to systematic SDD approach

## Technical Details
- **Technologies/frameworks**: Requirements engineering, EARS syntax, task management methodologies
- **Prerequisites**: Software development experience, project management basics, familiarity with AI development tools
- **Complexity level**: Intermediate methodology application with advanced workflow optimization
- **Practical applications**: Complex feature development, team coordination, AI tool enhancement, technical debt reduction

## Content Gaps & Questions
- **Personal Experience Details**: Need to leave substantial space for hands-on Kiro usage stories and workflow transformation examples
- **Specific SDD Implementation**: More concrete examples of how three phases work in practice
- **Comparison Depth**: Detailed contrast with other development methodologies and AI tools

## Research Notes
The research reveals strong foundation for article focusing on personal transformation narrative. Key insight: Most AI tool articles focus on features, but there's gap in systematic workflow methodology content. SDD represents significant differentiation by providing structured approach rather than just tool capabilities.

Important to reserve significant space for personal Kiro experience - this will be the unique value that differentiates from generic AI tool reviews.
