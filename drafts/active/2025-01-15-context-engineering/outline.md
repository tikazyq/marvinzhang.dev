### Section 1: From Simple Prompts to Smart Context (800-1000 words)
- **Focus**: Evolution from basic prompting to intelligent context selection
- **Learning Objective**: Understand why context selection matters and modern approaches
- **Content**:
  - Why simple prompts hit walls (token limits, lack of specificity)
  - What companies discovered: context quality > prompt cleverness
  - Modern patterns: RAG, memory systems, structured context
  - Real examples: How GitHub Copilot uses your codebase as context
- **Visual**: Mermaid diagram comparing simple prompt vs modern context patterns
- **Key Takeaway**: Context engineering is about information curation, not prompt tricks

### Section 2: The RAG Revolution - Dynamic Context Retrieval (800-1000 words)
- **Focus**: RAG as the dominant pattern for context management
- **Learning Objective**: Understand and implement basic RAG patterns
- **Content**:
  - What RAG actually is (in simple terms)
