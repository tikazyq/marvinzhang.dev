## The News

**What are you announcing?**
<!-- One sentence: what exists now that didn't before -->


**Version/release info?**
<!-- e.g., "v0.2.7, 10 releases since Nov 2" or "production-ready as of Nov 10" -->


---

## Why It Matters

**What problem does this solve?**
<!-- The pain point this addresses. Examples:
- "Existing SDD tools are too heavyweight for solo devs"
- "Vibe coding leads to context loss and technical debt"
- "AI assistants need structured context to perform well" -->


**Who is the target audience?**
<!-- Be specific. Examples:
- "Solo developers using AI coding assistants (Copilot, Cursor, Claude)"
- "Small teams adopting SDD for the first time"
- "Developers who want AI productivity without vibe coding chaos" -->


**What's the unique angle vs. alternatives?**
<!-- Why LeanSpec over Spec Kit, Kiro, OpenSpec, etc.? Examples:
- "Lightweight: <2,000 tokens per spec vs enterprise bloat"
- "AI-native: MCP server works with any AI tool"
- "First-principles: built on unchangeable constraints (physics, biology, economics)" -->

## Personal Story

**Origin: Why did you build this?**
<!-- What was the trigger? A specific pain point? Frustration with existing tools? -->


**Journey: Timeline and milestones**
<!-- e.g., "Started Oct 15, first release Nov 2, 10 releases in 3 weeks, 130+ specs written" -->


**Dogfooding: Are you using it yourself?**
<!-- Using LeanSpec to build LeanSpec? Stats, learnings, meta-observations? -->


**Community: Any early adopters or feedback?**
<!-- GitHub stars, discussions, issues, contributions? -->


---

## Technical Highlights (optional)

**Architecture decisions worth mentioning?**
<!-- e.g., "TypeScript monorepo with turborepo", "MCP protocol for AI integration" -->


**First principles you want to explain?**
<!-- Context Economy, Signal-to-Noise, Intent Over Implementation, Bridge the Gap, Progressive Disclosure -->


---

## Call to Action

**Primary CTA: What should readers do first?**
<!-- e.g., "Try the tutorial: `npx lean-spec init --example dark-theme`" -->

## Tone & Positioning

**Check one primary tone:**
- [ ] **Humble/practical**: "I built this to solve my own problem, maybe it helps you too"
- [ ] **Industry positioning**: "Here's what's missing in the SDD landscape"
- [ ] **Technical deep-dive**: Focus on first principles and architecture
- [ ] **Other**: _______________

**Relationship to your SDD Tools article?**
<!-- Your existing article covers 6 SDD tools. How does LeanSpec fit in?
- "LeanSpec is my answer to the lightweight gap I identified"
- "Complement to the landscape overview"
- "Don't mention the other article" -->
