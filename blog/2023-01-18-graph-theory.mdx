## Introduction

> "Entities should not be multiplied without necessity" -- Ockham's Razor Principle

**Graph Theory** is a mathematical foundational theory that has been severely underestimated by the public. It doesn't study images, pictures, or charts, but rather an abstract and simple mathematical theory. The **graph** in graph theory is an abstract concept, very similar to a relationship network, with corresponding **nodes** (or vertices), and associative relationships or **edges** between nodes. Graph theory concepts are very simple: graphs, nodes, and edges. This article will briefly introduce basic concepts of graph theory and its applications in the real world. (Note! This is not a scientific paper, so there won't be boring mathematical formulas - please enjoy reading)

## Graph Theory Overview

In graph theory, there are three important concepts:

1. **Node**: Can be understood as an entity, such as Zhang San, Li Si, Wang Wu in a relationship network;
2. **Edge**: Can be understood as relationships between entities, for example, Zhang San and Li Si are husband and wife, Wang Wu is their son;
3. **Graph**: Can be understood as the collection of all nodes and edges, such as the happy family composed of Zhang San, Li Si, and Wang Wu.

From these three basic concepts, we can infer relationships between nodes. For example, Li Si's older brother Li Yi would be Wang Wu's uncle, and Wang Wu would be his nephew.

Of course, graph theory applications go far beyond this. In our real world, graph theory applications are so widespread that ordinary people can hardly perceive their existence.

Below, we'll introduce common applications of graph theory in the technology field.

## Search Engines

Google, Baidu, Bing - these are all **search engines** we use daily. When we need to learn about something, we usually open a search engine, enter keywords, and the search engine returns relevant results that are usually extremely accurate. Actually, the core theory behind search engine technology is graph theory.

We can imagine each **web page** of a website as a **node**, **hyperlinks** on pages as corresponding **edges**, and the **website** as a **graph** containing all web pages (nodes) and webpage relationships (edges), as shown below.

The reason search engines can magically return search results to users is through clever application of the [PageRank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm, which represents node relationships using linear algebra, then calculates nodes or web pages most similar to keywords, finally achieving basic search functionality. Friends interested in PageRank algorithm can check relevant materials - there are many online, so I won't elaborate.

## Natural Language

**Natural Language** is actually languages used by natural humans in conversation, such as Chinese, English, Japanese, etc. For example, Zhang San telling Li Si "I love you," or you asking a friend "I discovered an amazing coffee shop downtown last week, want to go together this weekend?", or even all the text in this article - all are natural language.

So what's the relationship between graph theory and natural language? Actually, if we think carefully, we'll find that Chinese has three parts of speech: subject, predicate, and object, such as the simple subject-predicate-object sentence "I love you." In reality, this sentence can be represented by a graph, where the **subject** ("I") and **object** ("you") are **nodes**, and the **predicate** ("love") is an **edge**, representing the relationship from subject to object. Of course, for complex sentences, relationships become more complex, and corresponding graphs become more complex, but they can always be represented using graphs, nodes, and edges to show relationships between words.

The diagram below represents the sentence "Susan might not believe you" as a graph, which is a tree structure. A **tree** is also a type of graph - a special structure.

Currently popular translation software, speech recognition, chatbots, etc., all have Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology behind them that comes from graph theory.

**Food for thought**: Can program code (like Python) be processed using graph theory?

## Artificial Intelligence

Recently, **Artificial Intelligence** technology has become very popular, with core technology coming from deep neural networks, a special form of **neural networks**. Neural network concepts can be simply understood as structures similar to brain neural networks composed of neurons. Electrical signals from some neurons in the brain are transmitted to other neurons through neural networks, producing abstract concepts like consciousness, thoughts, and cognition. The logic behind this is very simple - electrical signal triggering, just in extremely large quantities. The success of today's deep neural networks also benefits from large-scale neural network computing systems built on computers. The GPT-3 language model from globally famous AI company [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) consists of 175 billion parameters, approaching the order of magnitude of adult brain neurons.

## Everything is Graph Theory

Graph theory concepts are very simple, like abstract concepts of atoms, molecules, and chemical bonds in the physical world, making them easy to process mathematically. Therefore, from the global internet to protein molecular structures, graph theory can be widely applied in most fields of the real world. Thus, learning graph theory well is very helpful for solving real problems in our work, life, and study. For example, optimal time scheduling problems can be modeled using graph theory; pivot tables commonly used by white-collar workers can also be processed using bipartite graphs from graph theory. Recently, I've also been trying to apply graph theory to intelligent web information extraction technology. Learning graph theory helps us better understand this world, allowing us to more reasonably handle our own lives and work.
