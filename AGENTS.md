# GitHub Copilot Agent Playbook

## Mission Snapshot
**Core concept: This repository hosts a Docusaurus 3.8.1 bilingual blog that must always use the `pnpm` workflow.**
- Root path serves blog content only; no docs section is present.
- English posts live in `blog/`; Chinese counterparts mirror them in `i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/` with identical slugs and dates.
- Follow `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for project-wide conventions and reference `.github/instructions/writing-guidelines.instructions.md` for Markdown authoring specifics.

<instructions>
Here is a list of instruction files that contain rules for modifying or creating new code.
These files are important for ensuring that the code is modified or created correctly.
Please make sure to follow the rules specified in these files when working with the codebase.
If the file is not already available as attachment, use the `read_file` tool to acquire it.
Make sure to acquire the instructions before making any changes to the code.
| File | Applies To | Description |
| ------- | --------- | ----------- |
| '.github/instructions/writing-guidelines.instructions.md' | **/*.md* | Markdown style, tone, and formatting rules |
| '.github/instructions/writing-workflow.instructions.md' | **/*.md* | 4-stage article creation workflow (Research → Outline → Writing → Refine) |
| '.github/instructions/economist-style-principles.instructions.md' | **/*.md* | The Economist-inspired writing principles: clarity, precision, active voice, concrete examples, and data-driven argumentation |

## Operational Directives
**Core concept: Agents need to respect the repository etiquette before touching files.**
- Always manage work through the todo list tool (one item in progress at a time, complete ASAP).
- Prefer the `apply_patch` editing flow; fall back to other edit tools only if necessary.
- When adding blog content, write directly in the final MDX location with `unlisted: true` until publication.
- Summaries or explanations should stay skimmable, friendly, and free of filler phrases.

:::note Workflow Essentials
- Never use `npm` or `yarn`; stick to `pnpm` for installs, scripts, and scaffolds.
- Keep instructions concise when reporting results; share deltas rather than repeating entire plans.

## Content Authoring Standards
**Core concept: Blog posts follow a four-stage, section-by-section writing process that balances depth with readability.**
- **Always determine the current date programmatically** for new articles (use `date +%Y-%m-%d` command, not training data memory). Pass the actual system date when scaffolding: `node scripts/drafts/scaffold.js "title" "YYYY-MM-DD"`.
- Use the scaffold script to create `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` with `research.md`, `outline.md`, and `progress.md` helpers.
- Structure each article with the prescribed section lengths (Intro 300–500 words, Main sections 600–1000 words, Conclusion 250–400 words).
- Highlight each section's main idea in bold at first mention, add short takeaways, and prefer diagrams/tables over long code blocks (≤10 lines when unavoidable).
- **Mermaid diagrams**: Style all nodes with explicit colors (`fill,stroke,color`) for light/dark theme compatibility.
- **MDX syntax**: Use JSX-style comments `{/* comment */}` not HTML comments `<!-- comment -->`. Add `{/* truncate */}` after the introduction to control blog list previews.
- **Bold formatting in Chinese**: When using multiple bold sections on the same line in Chinese text, add a space before the second `**` to ensure proper rendering (e.g., `这与 **语法属性（Syntactic Properties）** 形成对比`).
- **Bold formatting with quotes**: When bolding text that contains double quotes, add spaces inside the bold markers (e.g., `** "quoted text" **` not `**"quoted text"**`) to prevent MDX parsing issues.
- Introduce links on first reference only, aiming for official sources and meaningful anchor text.

### 4-Stage Workflow Quick Reference
1. **Research**: Validate topic viability, gather ≥5 authoritative sources, identify unique angle → complete `research.md`
2. **Outline**: Create detailed structure with section breakdown, word targets, visual plan → complete `outline.md`
3. **Writing**: Draft section-by-section directly in `blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` (unlisted: true) → one section per interaction
4. **Refine**: Review holistically, validate technical accuracy, ensure EN/ZH parity → flip unlisted to false, archive draft folder

## Localization & Draft Workflow
**Core concept: Maintain synchronized bilingual content and move drafts through the archive flow when publishing.**
- Every English post must have a matching Chinese translation with the same slug and metadata.
- Draft Markdown lives in the final location (`blog/...` and `i18n/zh/...`) with `unlisted: true` until release; flip to `false` and move the scaffold folder to `drafts/archive/` at publication.
- Keep frontmatter aligned (title, tags, date, authors) and ensure translations reflect updates made to the English version.
- **形不同而意同 (Same Meaning, Different Form)**: Chinese articles must read naturally and idiomatically, not as literal translations. Adapt sentence structures, expressions, and rhetoric to feel native to Chinese readers while preserving core concepts and technical accuracy.
- **Chinese articles must include English term annotations**: Add capitalized English translations in parentheses at first mention of technical terms (e.g., `可计算性理论（Computability Theory）`, `大型语言模型（Large Language Model，LLM）`), and use Chinese punctuation throughout (，、：instead of , ・ :).
- **Chinese articles must include English names for famous people**: Add English names in parentheses at first mention of notable individuals (e.g., `艾兹格·迪杰斯特拉（Edsger Dijkstra）`, `亨利·戈登·莱斯（Henry Gordon Rice）`, `艾伦·图灵（Alan Turing）`).
- **Chinese punctuation consistency**: Always use Chinese commas (，) instead of English commas (,) throughout Chinese articles, including in technical explanations and sentence structures.

| Step | English Path | Chinese Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Drafting | `blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` | `i18n/zh/docusaurus-plugin-content-blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.mdx` |
| Research assets | `drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` | Shared resources |
| Post-publication archive | `drafts/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` | Shared resources |

## Quality Gates & Verification
**Core concept: Validate meaningful changes locally and document the outcomes succinctly.**
- Run quick checks that match the scope of your edits; prioritize `pnpm run build` for production confidence and `pnpm dev` for smoke tests when relevant.
- Report PASS/FAIL status for build, lint, and tests; include failure summaries plus remediation steps or follow-ups.
- Note any assumptions or unresolved issues explicitly so maintainers can follow up effortlessly.
