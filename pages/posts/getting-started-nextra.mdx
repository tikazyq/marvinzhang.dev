## What is Nextra?

Nextra is a simple, powerful and flexible site generation framework with everything you love from Next.js. It's perfect for creating documentation sites and blogs with:

- **MDX Support**: Write content in Markdown with React components

- **Theming**: Beautiful, customizable themes

## Blog Structure

This blog is organized as follows:

```
pages/
├── index.mdx          # Homepage
├── about.mdx          # About page
└── posts/             # Blog posts directory
    └── *.mdx          # Individual blog posts
```

## Writing Posts

Each blog post is an MDX file with frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: YYYY/M/D
description: Brief description of the post
tag: comma, separated, tags
author: Author Name
---
```

## Features Available

const greeting = (name) => {
  return `Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog.`
}

console.log(greeting('World'))
```

</Callout>
